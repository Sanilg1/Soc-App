# SocietySync

A modern, full-stack society management solution designed to streamline the handling of complaints, common area issues, and service requests (like ironing) between residents, workers, and administrators. 

SocietySync is divided into two primary parts:
1. **Admin Dashboard (Next.js)** – A robust web portal for society management committees to track metrics, oversee unresolved complaints, manage residents and workers, and configure society settings.
2. **Mobile Application (Flutter)** – A sleek, user-friendly app for residents to log complaints/issues, track the status of their requests, and manage ironing bills, and for workers to view and update their assigned tasks.

## 🚀 Key Features

### For Residents (Mobile App)
- **Complaint Logging:** Easily raise a maintenance request for your flat with a preferred visit time.
- **Society Issue Reporting:** Report issues in common areas (e.g., broken streetlights, gym equipment).
- **Image Attachments:** Take photos directly from the camera or upload from the gallery to provide visual context for issues.
- **Ironing Bills:** Request ironing services and track your running bills transparently.
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Receive push notifications and track the progress of complaints from 'Queued' to 'Resolved'.

### For Workers (Mobile App)
- **Task Management:** View assigned complaints grouped by priority (Emergency vs. Routine).
- **Status Updates:** Update ticket statuses on the go (e.g., "Need Tools", "Visited", "Resolved").
- **Notes:** Leave specific notes on complaints for residents to see (e.g., "Waiting for spare parts").
- **Leave/Pause Requests:** Request time off or pause shifts directly through the app.

### For Administrators (Web Dashboard)
- **High-Level Analytics:** View Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like SLA breach rates, total open complaints, and ironing revenue.
- **Resident & Worker Management:** Maintain a directory of flats and registered workers, along with onboarding controls.
- **Escalation Management:** Track complaints that have breached SLAs or required emergency attention.
